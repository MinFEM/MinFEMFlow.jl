Unfortunately, we are not able to do this with MinFEM. However, there are also stabilization techniques for-first order elements available.

In particular, C is a discretization of the Laplacian, where the nodal contributions of each element T_k are scaled by fracoperatornamevol(T_k)sqrtd and is thus mesh dependent.
